Find the answer to the next question:
Why arrays in java initialize with fixed size and can’t be dynamic?

    Developers intended to make some kind of container for primitives or objects which give fast random access
by letting you use an index position to get any element from it. But they knew there can not exist perfect data
structures, and they must something to sacrifice. That’s why expand option was removed.

Last one:
        char x = 'X';
        int i = 0;
        System.out.println(true ? x : 0);  <-- we should use varibles of the same type.
        System.out.println(false ? i : x); <-- we should use varibles of the same type.
